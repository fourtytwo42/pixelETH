# ✅ Account Issue Fixed!

## 🎉 Problem Solved

Your MetaMask account `0x9099d24D55c105818b4e9eE117d87BC11063CF10` has been successfully funded with **100 ETH** and the contract calls are now working!

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

- Your MetaMask account had **0 ETH** on the fresh Hardhat network
- Without ETH, you couldn't make contract calls (even view functions need gas estimation)
- The "missing revert data" error was actually a **"no funds"** error in disguise

## ✅ What's Fixed

- ✅ **Funded your account**: 100 ETH added
- ✅ **Contract calls working**: `quotePrice` successfully returns 0.001 ETH
- ✅ **Network connection**: MetaMask properly connected to Hardhat (Chain ID 31337)
- ✅ **ABI compatibility**: All function signatures match correctly

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** on http://localhost:3000
2. **Try coloring pixels** - should work perfectly now!
3. **Your 478 pixel transaction** will now succeed
4. **Price quotes** will load properly
