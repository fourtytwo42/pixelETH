# 🔧 ABI Mismatch Fixed

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The "missing revert data" error was caused by **ABI mismatches** between the frontend and the deployed smart contract. The frontend was trying to decode return values with incorrect types.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### Fixed Return Types in `/web/src/lib/web3.ts`:

1. **`quotePrice(uint32 id, uint8 team)`**:
   - ❌ Was: `returns (uint128)`  
   - ✅ Now: `returns (uint256)`

2. **`getStepPrice(uint32 id)`**:
   - ❌ Was: `returns (uint128)`
   - ✅ Now: `returns (uint256)`

3. **`getMultiplierBps(uint8 team)`**:
   - ❌ Was: `returns (uint16)`
   - ✅ Now: `returns (uint256)`

4. **`getPixel(uint32 id)`**:
   - ❌ Was: `returns (address owner, uint128 lastPaid, uint24 color, uint8 team)`
   - ✅ Now: `returns (address owner, uint64 lastPaid, uint24 color, uint8 team)`

## 🎯 Root Cause

The error occurred because:
- Function selector `0x8726610f` = `quotePrice(uint32,uint8)` **does exist** in the contract
- The frontend was calling it correctly, but couldn't decode the return value
- Contract returns `uint256` but frontend expected `uint128`
- This caused a decoding failure that appeared as "missing revert data"

## ✅ Services Status

Both services are now running with the correct ABI:
- **🌐 Web Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (restarted with fixes)
- **🔗 Hardhat Node**: http://127.0.0.1:8545 (still running)
- **📍 Contract**: `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`

## 🧪 Expected Result

Your pixel coloring should now work correctly:
- ✅ Price quotes will load properly
- ✅ Pixel purchases will succeed
- ✅ Your 478 pixel transaction will work
- ✅ Canvas interactions will be smooth

**Try coloring pixels again - the ABI mismatch error should be resolved!** 🎨
